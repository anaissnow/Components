# Existing Project

To revisit any part of the initial setup, find the `Setup Wizard` at `Project > Tools > Run Maaack's Credits Scene Setup...`. Example files can be re-copied from the `Setup Wizard`, assuming they have not been deleted.

Update the game credits / attribution.

1.  Update the example `ATTRIBUTION.md` with the project's credits.
2.  Open `credits_label.tscn`.
3.  Check the `CreditsLabel` has updated with the text.
4.  Optionally, disable `Auto Update` and customize the text.
5.  Save the scene (even if it shows no changes).
